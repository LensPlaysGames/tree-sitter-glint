* Glint Parser based on Tree Sitter

If you are living under a rock: [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/]].

This is a parser implementation for the Glint language, a novel language designed as part of the [[https://github.com/LensPlaysGames/LensorCompilerCollection][Lensor Compiler Collection]].

** For Devs: To Update Grammar

If you've updated =grammar.js=, and have written sufficient (passing) tests for your new feature, the following steps will update the git repo with the new changes.

#+begin_src shell
  tree-sitter generate
  tree-sitter build
  tree-sitter test
#+end_src

*Make sure you have written tests for your new feature, and that they are passing!*

#+begin_src shell
  tree-sitter version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  tree-sitter generate
  tree-sitter build
  tree-sitter test
#+end_src

Obviously, update MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH to something reasonable.

Next, stage *everything* and commit it.
DO NOT FORGET TO TAG THE COMMIT (please).
#+begin_src shell
  git commit -am "Release MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
  git tag -- vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#+end_src

Push commit *and tags*.
#+begin_src shell
  git push --tags origin main
#+end_src
