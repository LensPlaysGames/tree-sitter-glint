for, common bug: missing separator
:error
:desc The current implementation of Glint in LCC parses `y z` as a call
      to `y` with one argument, `z`, leaving the `for` body completely empty.
      This causes an issue, because the user almost definitely intended `z`
      to be the body. Since we currently parse this correctly, I'm not sure
      if it's a bug in this parser or a bug in the LCC Glint parser...
